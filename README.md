<h1>Description</h1>
In this project, I created a mini honeynet in Azure by deploying Windows and Linux virtual machines with intentionally open firewall rules to attract attackers. To make the setup more appealing, I installed a vulnerable SQL Server on one of the VMs, encouraging brute force and SQL injection attempts. Logs from the VMs were collected in a Log Analytics workspace and connected to Microsoft Sentinel, where I built real-time attack maps and monitored threats. Over 24 hours, I observed security metrics in this insecure environment, applied controls to harden it, and measured the impact of those changes. This hands-on experience helped me better understand threat behavior, log management, and SIEM configuration.

- Azure Key Vault
- Azure Storage Account
- Log Analytics Workspace
- Microsoft Sentinel
- Network Security Group (NSG)
- Virtual Machines (2 windows, 1 linux)
- Virtual Network (VNet)
  
Prior , All the resources that were deployed was configured to be exposed to the internet in order to attract bad actors. I configured the Network Security Group on both Virtual Machines and created an inbound rule with low priority in order for the traffic to be evaluate first.


<h3>Conclusion</h3>
This project involved setting up a small honeynet in Microsoft Azure and connecting log sources to a Log Analytics workspace. Microsoft Sentinel was used to generate alerts and incidents from the logs. Metrics were recorded both before and after applying security controls. The results showed a significant drop in security events and incidents after implementing the controls, highlighting their effectiveness.

<h4></h4>
Also If the network resources were heavily used by more users, itâ€™s likely that more security events and alerts would have been triggered within the 24 hours after the security controls were applied.
