# Honeynet-In-Azure
<h1>Description</h1>
In this Project,I created a honeynet by deploying Windows and Linux virtual machines with intentionally open firewall rules to attract malicious actors. To make the setup more enticing, I installed a vulnerable SQL Server on one of the VMs, inviting attacks like brute force and SQL injection. Logs from both VMs were collected and sent to Microsoft Sentinel, where I built a real-time geographical map to track the source of attacks. This project gave me hands-on experience in log management, SIEM configuration, and understanding threat behavior. It was an engaging way to analyze attack patterns and strengthen my cybersecurity skills.
